<p>The wife over here, her grandma (who was married to a veteran of Okinawa, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/96th_Infantry_Division_%28United_States%29">Deadeye</a> of the 96th) had a term for the likes of which, would bring, instant and likely intense displeasure to her mind. A Shitass, quite plainly.</p>
<p>To me it suggests a non-wiping fuckwit who cannot get out of their own way. Oh and see? Wife just responded, &ldquo;yeah&rdquo; to my query on if her grandma would have agreed w/ my assessment.</p>
<p>So anyway, because I have the bandwidth and ability, the spirit of my parents and grandparents animating me, I <strong>had</strong> to build this site.
Our Veep, the Thiel acolyte, JD Vance? Hey, he told folks to write an essay instead of protesting. Well, OK JD, you mighty-personality-morphing power ranger. Here it is, now suck my dick, from the back.
People, that JD has been led to &ldquo;water&rdquo; (read: money and power) by Thiel, should be a definate pause for concern, in all of us. This isn&rsquo;t any good at all&hellip; Shit, I&rsquo;m seguing like a wide bus down a narrow street, that&rsquo;s another poosting. It is though, simple. The shitasses have moved in.</p>
