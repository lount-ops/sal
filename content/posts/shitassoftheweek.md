Hugo uses the excellent [Go][] [html/template][gohtmltemplate] library for
its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very

logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other

similarities in Go templates.

This document is a brief primer on using Go templates. The [Go docs][gohtmltemplate]
provide more details.
