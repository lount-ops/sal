## The Shitass Parade

## Week of Jan 25th - 31st:

ICE Barbie Noem. Queen of the MAGA Prom.

K. Noem is seemingly, a horrid person.

She is now a known blatant liar, on air, easy peasy to catch her vile act;
[Noem, Lying to the Nation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amhb8PK_an8) about Alex Pretti being some kind of "terrorist".
Does she hide behind trying to scare people? Oh yeah. Does she know absolutely nothing about the laws she is supposed to be dealing with? Hmmmmmm. If one listens to Noem attempting to answer serious questions, for any length of time, it's apparant she's lacking any serious study into the topics she tries to stumble through.

Will she do anything for Donald Trump that serves her greed? Um, in my opinion, after her Pretti speech. She'll do anything it takes to accomplish what the orange dildo wants. The woman that Noem could have become, if not apparantly seducded by fuck-tons of cash and opportunity, could have been a powerful force for positive change in this nation.

I suppose it's easier to just say WTF, I need to get paid.

#### Cos-Play Time Anyone? Damn if she ain't Tacticool!

Yeah, that's one real winner.
