## Murder Crew

### ICE? BORTAC?, The Government murders Alex Pretti, from behind, while he is on hands and knees.

UPDATE: **The Runt**  got moved, because he lies like a goddamned rug.
Too bad he'll likely get to keep pension and get qualified immunity for attempted cover up of Pretti's murder.

## We all knew Bovino is a real, cee u next tuesday, sort.
What's lying to cover murder up, for The Runt?

The public backlash causing The 'ol Runt-o-rooni to flee? I don't think it'll impact the administration's **"Fear of the Other Tour, 2026"**. Stephen Miller is some kinda far-out goddamned ghoul who thrives on this shit. His strident, freakish yammering about white replacement due to liberalism? It's completely inline with the ["November Criminals"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_myth) horseshit a certain wretched Austrian corporal latched onto all those years ago. 

Cowards can [run on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IStlBOX9F4o) for a long time, but it all comes out in the open.

I hope the the [eight people](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/28/deaths-ice-2026-) who have died in 2026, in the name of stopping "white replacement", are the last. Doesn't life matter to us?
