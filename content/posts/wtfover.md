## The Internet, has not Been Your Friend.
 But here we are. Take a look around, it appears sorta sketchy and not friendly right now. The disinformation onion that is the Internet, has fucked the United States up, flatter than a hammered cock. How useful is a hammered cock people?

 Why is it we always want to believe the worst about one another, without really looking at ourselves?

 I'm left with assumptions, can't answer the above other than to hazard, we forget to act and think from a place of love. The universe for humans, is governed by fear and love. We have to choose daily, how we are going to approach the world. 

## Flat Earth and Q; Critical Thinking Remains Deeply Unpopular.
 Before the prominance in our lives of the Internet, both Flat Earth and Q proponents would have been committed to an asylum or learned to keep shit on the down low.

 The American penchant for contrarianism and anti-intellectualism has now been given the biggest microphone ever. That the Earth can be proven a globe is no matter to people who have decided, they know the truth bc of secret sources that, 'the they's' don't want us to know about.

 It's ok that some people are smarter (or faster, stronger, Etc...) than us. Yo! It all leavens out. It does suck that things like, "Nicotene has been shown to cause cancer." But it took smart people to figure it out for the rest of us, corporations were just going to keep taking adavntage of human addictive behavior and kill us early to make a buck.

 Conversley though, smart motherfuckers shouldn't be just thinking all the rest of us are stupid. Again, it all leavens out and truely, we're all in it together.

## Step 3. Change.
 Sometimes, some change is needed, so things can run better. Change is required on all sides of the coin. Neither political party is worth a wet cotton sock in a snowstorm, as both are locked in thrall to corporate money and social networking likes.

 There is a huge amount of money arrayed against meaningful change. In my opinion, unlimited money. The rich have decided were going back to the 1800's style of global carve up. What can I say about that other than, greed blinds folks from historical facts. I guess that when yer rich as Midas, you begin to believe that, you aren't subject to the same mistakes others have made before. Drunks call it, ten foot tall 'n bulletproof. Some philosophers would call it, an egoic lack of self honesty. I call it, morons with money.

 We have to practice and get better at not taking their money for inaction. If anything, heh. We need to fool them into funding our action to corral their power and ability to wreak havoc on our lives.

## Step 4. Having and being a better nation.
 Isn't having and holding something that lives up to the founding documents of the United States of America a worthy 'thinig' in and of itself? I believe myself to be deeply American and was raised with the values of my Grandparents. The generation who so many look to through a nostolgic haze, the folks who held it down throughout the scrap w/ Imperial Japan and the Third Reich. What's funny is the grandparents who raised me, could look candidly at the past they had survived and agree that, "The only good thing about the good old days is that they are gone." I mean it quite literally as well, they survived.
 He (and a few hundred other souls) had a ship blown out from under him and sunk sitting at Lunga Roads, Ironbottom Sound, Solomon Islands. Then, after he and other shipless lads, formed Advanced Naval Base parties, to man the forward bases built by CB's. On Vella Lavella, while attempting to save some lads from NZ, he picked up a Silver Star and his second Purple Heart (single star).
 She got Tuberculosis when my ma was a kid. Was put into a sanitarium w/ the other 'lungers' (she told me that when I was 7, to my horror), so that he and my ma would go see her on weekends. For six months. They were tough as nails just because they had to be, when it was needed.
 My dad's parents were slightly more conservative, but cast from the same mold of needing to be tough because of the times.

 Not going to varnish over things, both sets of grandparents had some (to me, as a kid), astonishing racial views. That said however, they all were willing to modify beliefs as they got older. Not out of fear either, they all trusted people like my ma, who in a lot of ways, was a very progressive type, and introduced them to different people of different backgrounds.

 The biggest catch to it all, those crafty grandparents of mine. They really meant it when they told me, "It matters not what color, creed or original nationality. When someone is here and a, law-abiding, participating member of American society, they are welcome to the club."

## So.
### Go fuck yerself Stephen Miller, and fuck Project2025-26.
 Vought and Miller, sitting in a tree. One tried to screw, the crease in the others knee. First came hate, then came marraige, they push Trump around in a baby carraige.

 Hideous rhymes aside, were in a pickle. The 'elites' are seemingly trying to lock dissent out via their tools in D.C. and at the regional level. But it's financial as well. The push for the U.S. stablecoin looks to be enmeshed w/ the Trump family in too many ways to be good for anyone else. The family's past is the record to go off of, and it's corrupt. Seemingly, nothing they do is above board.

 Note, not grandparent condoned language, but they'd get it at this point in time. I knew them well enough, as they lived long lives and were in their late 40's when I was born. They hooked me up w/ some choice vocab. One of the sayings I'm remembering most right now is; "The fix is in."

 Back with more scuttlebutt later on!
