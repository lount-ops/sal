The wife over here, her grandma (who was married to a veteran of Okinawa, a [Deadeye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/96th_Infantry_Division_(United_States)) of the 96th) had a term for the likes that brought instant and likely intense displeasure to her mind. A Shitass, quite plainly. A non-wiping fuckwit who cannot get out of their own way, is how I see it. Wife just responded, "yeah" to my query on if her grandma would have agreed w/ my assessment.

So anyway, because I have the bandwidth and ability, the spirit of my parents and grandparents animating me, I had to build this site. Our veep, the Thiel acolyte, JD Vance, told folks to write an essay instead of protesting. Well, OK JD, you mighty-personality-morphing power ranger. Here it is, now suck my dick, from the back. That JD has been led to water by Thiel, should be a definate pause for concern. Shit though, I'm seguing like a wide bus down a narrow street.

### I hate to think...
#### What would her grandpa have thought about people wrapping themselves in words of freedom and love, then doing the exact opposite to the nation that is supposed to be governed by them?

Wife's uncle is a 'Nam vet, even he couldn't comprehend the death machine his dad had gotten sent into... And her Uncle saw 'the shit' as a damn convoy gunner in the late 1960's, had intimate knowledge of immediate and personal danger to oneself. Yeah, Wife's grandpa wouldn't be impressed at all, with this authoritarian worshipping lot. The asshats in charge like to take a bunch of 'Christian Nation under God' gibberish, but it's all it is. A giant wooden nickle people, ain't worth a damn."

## We value approaching life without side-stepping responsibility.
#### Kuleana/Personal Responsibility is the core of our existence. To turn away from it, is to relinquish ones soul.
##### Operating from love as opposed to fear, is true courage.

To qualify ourselves as flawed, decent, humans;

So yeah, I believe in community and truth. Wife, she was always a straight-shooter, still is. We both believe that love is a better tool and frame of mind, than fear.

We do our utmost to remember that, denial isn't just a river in Egypt. If it sounds to good to be true, it is. Finally, my favorite; Technology isn't going to fix anything technology has broken.

Aloha nui loa.
