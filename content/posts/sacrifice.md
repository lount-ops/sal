## Those Who Came Before Me

### "It's a free country, if you have money." Is what my grandfather told me once.

Heh, didn't stick in like it should. I have a mouth though, and can flap the shit outta my gums. I can't really write all to well, but ability hasn't stopped me yet.

My grandfather served in the USNR during WW2. He (and a whole buncha other coxwains) landed troops in N. Africa, 8 November 1942. Once the landing were done, the ship he was on (USS John Penn), headed to Norfolk, VA. By 17 Dec, 1942, they were headed to the Canal Zone and onto New Caledonia in the Pacific Theatre. The ship sailed in hotly contested waters until August 1943. She arrived at Guadalcanal and anchored at Lunga Roads.

The USS John Penn (APA 23) was attacked by IJN B5N's ("Kate") and while fighting them off, one of the planes got hit, went out of control and hit the Penn in the mainmast area. Right around the same instant, another Kate's torpedo hit her on the starboard side. She sank in about 130' of water.

My grandfather, was blown into a bulkhead and then launched overboard with all the blast concussion and violent lifting of the ship. He didn't remember hitting water but woke up soon after (his account). He doesn't remember getting fished out, but remembered the boat pulling up to pier and the marines helping them into the arms of corpmen.

He ended up getting the shit shot out of him, running an LCVP into an extermely narrow (read enfilading) bay in the dead hours of the early morning, Solomon Islands, Vella Lavella, early October, 1944. He, his crew and a half dozen New Zealanders, were going to attempt to get NewZealanders, at the head of the bay, out of the tight squeeze their battalion found itself in.

I've since learned more, but that's all grampa ever told me. It turned FUBAR fast and he was lucky to make it home. he never once displayed the medals or the souviners he brought back. He knew young men are fooled by medals and trinkets from wars in far away places, why glorify having to put other humans in the ground?

He raised me to always be skeptical of what politicians promised. At the end of it all, he watched the nation go through the most unreal growth ever, then begin to drastically decline, especially with regards to how citizenry are taxed. The carve outs for rich now are obscene, I'll save that for another posting.

He'd of had to have fought nausea off w/ regards to the current crew that runs our shitass life here in the U.S.A. If a German newspaper is thinking G. Bovino looks like an Ernst Rohem wannabe, my grandpa's crew would be puking.

### I hate to think...

What would wife's grandpa have thought about folks wrapping themselves in the flag and spounting words of freedom and patriotism, then performing actions designed to have the opposite effect on this nation. The home that he'd gone off to fight the IJN for. He got the shit shot out of him in the Phillipines and healed up, then went to Okinawa and had it done to him again. Because the nation asked him, he went and did it. It was a nation worth fighting for then. Look where greed has gotten us. Below is a map of some of the ground Wife's grandpa and his buddies in the 96th got intimate with. If you know about Okinawa, you know.

  caption="I've read about this part of that battle a few times now and am astounded that anyone made it at all. Of note, Mr. [Desmond Doss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Doss) was considered not only a hero, but a good luck charm, by the men who served closely with him at the Maedea Escarpment. A class act of a human being and a fine American, who wouldn't willingly touch a firearm. Wife's grandpa's company (G Co., 381st, 96th) hit the top of the ridge, eighteen casualties were sustained in a matter of minutes.

## We (Wife 'n I) were raised by and around good men. Gentle and kind men.
Men who had been asked to risk it all in hot, malaria infested environments that every once and awhile, had what the German's called, ***"Steel Weather"***. Men who considered themselves Christian, but didn't overdo it, leaving church for the wives and just hitting the Christmas and Easter magic shows.
There wasn't frothing anti-immigrant fear and hate. Wife's family goes back further here in the U.S., but hell... My grandpa was second generation. His grandparents (Catholic grandpa, Jewish grandma) bailed on Europe because of inflexible intolerance and never ending wars.
We are all immigrants, even the original colonists. Hell, go back far enough, it's just the story of us (humanity). Long term, mass immigration, to find a better place to live.

## Now w/ Agent Orange v.2
The fix is in. Greed is good and lets burn the joint down so Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Sergey Brin, Larry Page and the rest of the morons with money can take it over and screw us forever.
